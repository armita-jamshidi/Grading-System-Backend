# Grading-System-Backend

In this repository, we make use of SQLalchemy association tables to create the backend of a grading system application. Users are able to input their information associated with the school, their courses, and assignments for each course. In this way, we explore surjective, injective, and bijective relationships between Course, User, and Assignment objects.
